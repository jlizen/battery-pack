## Tracking work-in-progress

The file WIP.md (when it exists) tracks our current ongoing task.

It is *very imporatnt* to keep it updated as you work so that we can remember what we have done and pick the work up again in a fresh session. Always edit the WIP.md file after completing work without waiting for confirmation from the user.

When we start a new session, read WIP.md (if it exists) to get oriented.
