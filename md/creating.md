# Creating a Battery Pack

A battery pack is a normal Rust crate published on crates.io.
It has no real code — just a Cargo.toml that curates dependencies,
plus documentation, examples, and optionally templates.

## Scaffolding

The fastest way to start is:

```bash
cargo bp new battery-pack --name my-battery-pack
```

This creates a new battery pack project from the built-in template,
complete with the right structure, a starter README, and license files.

## Anatomy of a battery pack

Here's what a battery pack looks like:

```
my-battery-pack/
├── Cargo.toml
├── README.md
├── docs.handlebars.md
├── src/
│   └── lib.rs
├── examples/
│   ├── basic.rs
│   └── advanced.rs
└── templates/
    └── default/
        ├── cargo-generate.toml
        ├── Cargo.toml.liquid
        └── src/
            └── main.rs
```

The important parts:

- **Cargo.toml** — defines the curated crates as dependencies
- **README.md** — your prose documentation
- **docs.handlebars.md** — template for auto-generated docs on docs.rs
- **src/lib.rs** — just a doc include (no real code)
- **examples/** — runnable examples showing the crates in action
- **templates/** — project templates for `cargo bp new`

## Defining crates

Your curated crates are just regular Cargo dependencies. The dependency
section they live in determines the default dependency kind for users:

```toml
[dependencies]
anyhow = "1"
thiserror = "2"

[dev-dependencies]
expect-test = "1.5"

[build-dependencies]
cc = "1"
```

When a user installs your battery pack:
- `anyhow` and `thiserror` default to regular dependencies
- `expect-test` defaults to a dev-dependency
- `cc` defaults to a build-dependency

Users can override these in the TUI.

## Features for grouping

Use Cargo's `[features]` to organize crates into groups:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
clap = { version = "4", features = ["derive"] }
dialoguer = "0.11"
indicatif = { version = "0.17", optional = true }
console = { version = "0.15", optional = true }

[features]
default = ["clap", "dialoguer"]
indicators = ["indicatif", "console"]
fancy = ["clap", "indicatif", "console"]
```

### The default feature

The `default` feature determines which crates a user gets with a plain
`cargo bp add`. Crates not in `default` are available but not installed
unless the user explicitly enables them (e.g., `cargo bp add cli -F indicators`).

If you don't define a `default` feature, all non-optional crates
are included by default.

### Optional crates

Mark crates as `optional = true` if they shouldn't be part of the default
installation. These crates are available through named features or
individual selection in the TUI.

### Feature augmentation

A feature can add Cargo features to a crate, not just toggle it on.
This uses Cargo's native `dep/feature` syntax:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["macros", "rt"] }

[features]
default = ["tokio"]
tokio-full = ["tokio/full"]
```

Enabling `tokio-full` keeps `tokio` but adds the `full` feature on top
of `macros` and `rt`. Feature merging is always additive.

## Hidden dependencies

If your battery pack has dependencies that are internal tooling — not
something users would want to install — mark them as hidden:

```toml
[package.metadata.battery-pack]
hidden = ["handlebars", "cargo-metadata"]
```

Hidden crates don't appear in the TUI or in `cargo bp show` output.

You can use globs:

```toml
[package.metadata.battery-pack]
hidden = ["serde*"]
```

Or hide everything (useful if your battery pack is purely templates and examples):

```toml
[package.metadata.battery-pack]
hidden = ["*"]
```

## The lib.rs

A battery pack's `lib.rs` is minimal — it just includes auto-generated documentation:

```rust
#![doc = include_str!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/docs.md"))]
```

This makes the battery pack's documentation visible on docs.rs,
including an auto-generated table of all curated crates.
See [Documentation and Examples](./docs-and-examples.md) for details
on how the doc generation works.

## Templates

Templates let users bootstrap new projects with `cargo bp new`.
They use [cargo-generate](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate)
under the hood.

A template lives in a subdirectory under `templates/`:

```
templates/
└── default/
    ├── cargo-generate.toml
    ├── Cargo.toml.liquid
    └── src/
        └── main.rs
```

The `cargo-generate.toml` configures template variables:

```toml
[template]
cargo_generate_version = ">=0.22.0"

[placeholders.description]
type = "string"
prompt = "What does this project do?"
default = "A new project"
```

Register templates in your Cargo.toml metadata:

```toml
[package.metadata.battery.templates]
default = { path = "templates/default", description = "A basic starting point" }
subcmds = { path = "templates/subcmds", description = "Multi-command CLI" }
```

If you have multiple templates, users can choose:

```bash
cargo bp new my-pack --template subcmds
```
